## Description
Our project aims to develop a sophisticated hand gesture recognition model utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately identify and classify various hand gestures from image or video data. The primary objective is to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and facilitate gesture-based control systems in diverse applications.

With the proliferation of digital devices and the increasing demand for seamless user experiences, the traditional input methods have become limiting. Hand gesture recognition offers a promising alternative, allowing users to interact with devices in a natural and intuitive manner. Whether it's controlling electronic appliances, navigating virtual environments, or enhancing accessibility for individuals with disabilities, the potential applications of this technology are vast and varied.
